## Machine Language

- A computer’s CPU is incapable of understanding C++. Instead, CPUs are only capable of processing instructions written in **machine language** (or **machine code**). The set of all possible machine language instructions that a given CPU can understand is called an **instruction set**.
	- Here is a sample machine language instruction: `10110000 01100001`.
- The number of bits in a machine language instruction varies -- for example, some CPUs process instructions that are always 32 bits long, whereas some other CPUs (such as those from the x86 family, which you may be using) have instructions that can be a variable length.
	### Fixed-Length Instructions
	
	In some CPU architectures, such as those based on **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)** principles (e.g., ARM or MIPS), instructions are **fixed-length**. This means every instruction has the same number of bits, such as 32 bits. This design simplifies the instruction decoding process for the CPU, leading to faster and more predictable execution. However, it can be less space-efficient because smaller operations still require the full length of the instruction.
	
	### Variable-Length Instructions
	
	Other CPU architectures, such as **CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)** architectures like the x86 family, use **variable-length** instructions. In these architectures:
	
	- Instructions can range in size (e.g., from 1 byte to 15 bytes on modern x86 CPUs).
	- The length of an instruction depends on factors like the operation being performed, the addressing mode, the size of the operands, and additional prefixes.
	
	This variable-length approach allows for a more compact encoding of instructions, especially for frequently used operations. For example:
	
	- Simple operations might use short instructions (e.g., a single byte for basic arithmetic).
	- More complex operations or those with larger operands might require longer instructions.
	
	### Trade-offs
	
	1. **Fixed-Length Instructions:**
	    
	    - **Pros:** Simplified decoding and pipelining, leading to potentially higher performance.
	    - **Cons:** Wastes memory for simple instructions that don’t need the full length.
	2. **Variable-Length Instructions:**
	    
	    - **Pros:** More compact instruction encoding, reducing memory usage and improving cache efficiency.
	    - **Cons:** Increased complexity in the CPU’s instruction decoder, which can slow down processing and complicate parallel execution.
	
	### Practical Example
	
	- **Fixed-Length (RISC Example):** In a MIPS processor, every instruction is exactly 32 bits. If a "load word" instruction or an "add" instruction is needed, they both take up the same number of bits.
	- **Variable-Length (CISC Example):** In an x86 processor, a "move" operation might be encoded in just 2 bytes, while a more complex instruction with multiple operands or prefixes could take up to 15 bytes.
	
	The choice between fixed and variable length is a fundamental aspect of CPU design, influenced by trade-offs between simplicity, performance, and memory efficiency.
- Second, each family of compatible CPUs (e.g. x86, Arm64) has its own machine language, and this machine language is not compatible with the machine language of other CPU families. This means machine language programs written for one CPU family cannot be run on CPUs from a different family!
	- Machine language, also known as the **instruction set architecture (ISA)**, is the lowest-level code that a CPU understands and executes directly. Each CPU family has its own unique ISA, defining the specific instructions, formats, and binary encodings that the CPU can process. As a result, machine language programs written for one CPU family cannot run on CPUs from a different family. Here's why:

	### 1. **Unique Instruction Sets**
	
	Each CPU family (e.g., **x86**, **Arm64**, **MIPS**) has its own **instruction set architecture**, which determines:
	
	- **Instruction formats**: How operations are encoded into binary bits.
	- **Available instructions**: The types of operations (e.g., arithmetic, logical, data movement) the CPU can perform.
	- **Addressing modes**: How instructions refer to memory or registers.
	- **Registers**: The number and names of general-purpose and special-purpose registers.
	
	For example:
	
	- An **x86 CPU** expects instructions encoded using the x86 ISA, with variable-length instructions and specific addressing modes.
	- An **Arm64 CPU** uses a completely different ISA, with fixed-length instructions and an entirely different set of registers and operation encodings.
	
	### 2. **Incompatibility of Encodings**
	
	The binary encoding for instructions in one ISA does not match the encoding in another ISA. A program compiled for x86 will have binary instructions that make no sense to an Arm64 CPU and vice versa.
	
	For example:
	
	- An x86 instruction like `MOV EAX, 5` (move the value 5 into the EAX register) has a specific binary encoding.
	- On an Arm64 CPU, this binary sequence might correspond to a completely unrelated or even invalid operation.
	
	### 3. **Hardware-Specific Design**
	
	CPU architectures are designed to optimize performance for their specific ISA:
	
	- **x86** processors are complex instruction set computers (CISC), designed for variable-length instructions and complex operations.
	- **Arm64** processors are reduced instruction set computers (RISC), optimized for simpler, fixed-length instructions and power efficiency.
	
	Because these architectures are fundamentally different, the machine languages are inherently incompatible.
	
	### 4. **Role of the Compiler**
	
	Programs written in high-level languages (like C++ or Python) are not tied to any specific ISA. They are compiled or interpreted into machine code that matches the target CPU's architecture. The same source code can be compiled to produce x86 or Arm64 machine code, but the resulting binaries will work only on the corresponding CPU family.
	
	### 5. **Emulation as a Workaround**
	
	To run programs written for one CPU family on another, **emulation** can be used. Emulators like QEMU simulate the behavior of a different CPU, translating instructions from one ISA to another in real-time. However, this comes with significant performance overhead.
	
	### Key Takeaway
	
	Each CPU family has a unique "language" optimized for its design. Machine language compatibility is tied directly to the CPU architecture, so binaries compiled for one architecture cannot run natively on another without special software like emulators or cross-compilers. This architectural difference is why programs must often be recompiled or adapted when moving between systems with different CPU types.
### Assembly Language

- ==> Assembly language is easy to understand in comparison to machine language which are instruction set of 0 and 1.
- ==> x86 Assembly Instruction: `mov al, 061h`
	- `mov` is an assembly command that copies a value into some location. In this case, the value `061h` will be copied into the `al` CPU register (memory that is part of the CPU itself).
	- `ov al, 061h` copies the hexadecimal value `061h` into the CPU register `AL` (a small memory location in the CPU).
- ==> But since computers only understand machine language so assembly code will be translated into machine code and this is done by a program `assembler`, which takes assembly code as input and gives machine code as an output.
- ==> Assembly language and machine language have same Downsides:
	- Assembly programs are hard to understand. While individual assembly instructions are understandable, it can be hard to deduce what a section of assembly code is actually doing. And since assembly programs require many instructions to do even simple tasks, they tend to be quite long.
	- Assembly programs are not **portable**. Each CPU family has its own assembly language, which is designed to be assembled into machine language for that same CPU family. A program written in assembly language cannot be easily assembled to machine language for a different CPU family.
- ==> **Fine-grained Control**: It allows direct interaction with hardware, offering precise control over CPU instructions and memory.
- **Why Assembly Is Still Used**:
	Despite its challenges, assembly language is still used in specific scenarios:

	1. **Performance-critical code**:
	    - Tasks requiring the highest possible speed, such as operating system kernels or performance-sensitive algorithms.
	2. **Embedded systems**:
	    - Devices with limited memory and processing power, like microcontrollers.
	3. **Hardware interaction**:
	    - Writing drivers or interacting directly with hardware where precise control is required.
### High-Level Language

- To address the comprehension and portability concerns of machine language and assembly, new programming languages such as C, C++, Pascal (and later, languages such as Java, Javascript, and Perl) were developed. These languages are called **high level languages**.
- They also like assembly language need to be translated into machine langauge and there are two ways to do it: 
	- **Compliling**:  C++ programs are usually compiled. A **compiler** is a program (or collection of programs) that reads source code (typically written in a high-level language) and translates it into some other language (typically a low-level language, such as machine language or assembly (which can then be assembled into machine language)). These machine language files are typically then combined into an executable file (containing machine language instructions) that can be run or distributed to others. Notably, running the executable file does not require the compiler to be installed.![[Compiling-min 1.webp]]
	- **Interpreting**: Alternatively, an **interpreter** is a program that directly executes the instructions in the source code without requiring them to be compiled into an executable first. Interpreters tend to be more flexible than compilers, but are less efficient when running programs because the interpreting process needs to be done every time the program is run. This also means the interpreter must be installed on every machine where an interpreted program will be run.![[Interpreting-min.webp]]
	- ==> Another advantage of compiled programs is that distributing a compiled program does not require distributing the source code. In a non-open-source environment, this is important for intellectual property (IP) protection purposes.
	- ==> Most languages can be either compiled or interpreted. Traditionally high-level languages like C, C++, and Pascal are compiled, whereas “scripting” languages like Perl and Javascript tend to be interpreted. Some languages, like Java, use a mix of the two.
- ==> High level languages tend to be designed with portability in mind. If we’re careful, we can write a single program and then compile it so it can be run on many different platforms. A **cross-platform** program is one that is designed to be run on more than one platform.
	### **Portability and Compilation**

	1. **Platform Independence**:
	    
	    - High-level languages are not tied to any specific machine architecture or operating system. Instead, they rely on compilers or interpreters to translate the code into machine language that can run on a specific platform.
	    - For example:
	        - A C++ program written on Windows can be recompiled for Linux using a Linux-compatible compiler.
	        - A Java program is compiled into bytecode, which can be executed on any machine with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
	2. **Write Once, Run Anywhere**:
	    
	    - If written carefully, a single program can be compiled or interpreted for multiple platforms, reducing the need to rewrite the code for each platform.
	    
	### **What is a Cross-Platform Program?**

	A **cross-platform program** is a program designed to run on multiple operating systems or environments with minimal or no changes. This can be achieved by:
	
	1. **Using a Cross-Platform Framework**:
	    
	    - Libraries or tools (e.g., Qt for C++, Flutter for UI, Electron for JavaScript) enable developers to create programs that run on various platforms.
	2. **Standardized Intermediate Code**:
	    
	    - Languages like Java compile to an intermediate bytecode that is executed by the platform-specific JVM, ensuring the program works across systems.
	3. **Conditional Compilation**:
	    
	    - In languages like C or C++, preprocessor directives (`#ifdef`, `#endif`) allow developers to include platform-specific code when necessary while keeping the majority of the codebase shared.
	### **Examples of Cross-Platform Software**

	- **Web Browsers**: Applications like Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
	- **Programming Languages**: Python, Java, and JavaScript applications are inherently cross-platform due to their runtime environments (e.g., Python interpreter, JVM, web browser).
	- **Game Engines**: Unity and Unreal Engine allow developers to deploy games across PCs, consoles, and mobile devices.
	
	### **Key Takeaways**
	
	- High-level languages enable portability by abstracting hardware and OS specifics, allowing the same source code to be compiled or interpreted on different platforms.
	- A **cross-platform program** is designed to work seamlessly on multiple platforms, often leveraging frameworks, intermediate bytecode, or conditional compilation to achieve compatibility.
	- While portability simplifies development for multiple platforms, developers must address challenges such as platform-specific features and performance optimization.
