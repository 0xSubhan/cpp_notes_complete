- How C++ Programs are developed:

### Step 1
- This is the "What" step, what you want to develop, an idea. e.g: "i want to build a tracking system".
### Step 2: Determine how you are going to solve the problem
- This is the "How" step. ==> [How Step, very important](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-cpp-development/#:~:text=This%20is%20the%20%E2%80%9Chow,trouble%20down%20the%20road.)
### Step 3: Write the program
- ==> [Step 3 Write the program](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-cpp-development/#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20write,in%20the%20next%20lesson.)

### Introduction to the compiler, linker and libraries

### Step 4: Compiling your source code
- ==> [compiling your source code](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-the-compiler-linker-and-libraries/#:~:text=Step%204%3A%20Compiling,do%20so%20now.)
- ==> Source code is translated into object code first.
### Step 5: Linking object files and libraries
- ==> program called linker is used to combine all object files and produce an executable file. This process is called linking.

- ==> [About linking object files and libraries](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-the-compiler-linker-and-libraries/#:~:text=Step%205%3A%20Linking,up%20your%20project).
- ==> All this process of converting source code into executable file is called building and its result as an build. ==> [About Building](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-the-compiler-linker-and-libraries/#:~:text=Building,this%20tutorial%20series.)
### Step 6&7: Testing and Debugging

==> [About Testing and Debugging](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-the-compiler-linker-and-libraries/#:~:text=Steps%206%20%26%207,in%20future%20chapters.)
