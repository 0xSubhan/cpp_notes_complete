### Compiler Extension
### 1. **The C++ Standard**

The **C++ standard** is a formal specification that defines the language's syntax, semantics, and behavior. It ensures that C++ programs behave consistently across different platforms and compilers when they adhere to the standard.

### 2. **Compiler Extensions**

- **What are they?** Compiler extensions are additional features or behaviors that a compiler implements, beyond what the C++ standard specifies. These extensions often make the compiler compatible with other languages (e.g., C99) or provide historical functionality for legacy code.
    
- **Examples of extensions:**
    
    - Allowing variable declarations after statements in older C++ versions (before C++11).
    - Providing extra built-in functions or keywords specific to the compiler (e.g., `__attribute__` in GCC or `__declspec` in MSVC).

### 3. **Issues with Compiler Extensions**

- **Non-standard behavior:** Programs that rely on compiler extensions won't be portable. Other compilers may not support these extensions, leading to compilation errors or incorrect program behavior.
    
- **Confusion for new learners:** Beginners might think certain behaviors (enabled by compiler extensions) are part of the C++ standard, which can lead to incorrect understanding and practices.
    

### 4. **Why Disable Compiler Extensions?**

- **Portability:** Disabling extensions ensures that your program adheres strictly to the C++ standard, making it portable across different compilers and platforms.
    
- **Learning the standard:** Turning off extensions forces you to stick to standard-compliant C++, helping you develop better coding practices.
    

### 5. **How to Disable Compiler Extensions**

- **GCC/Clang:** Use the `-std=c++17`, `-std=c++20`, or similar flags to specify a standard. Add `-pedantic` to enforce strict compliance.
- **MSVC:** Use `/permissive-` to disable non-standard behaviors.

### 6. **Best Practice**

Always strive to write standard-compliant code unless you have a very specific reason to use a compiler extension. Disabling extensions helps ensure:

- Your code works on any standards-compliant compiler.
- You follow good programming practices.

### Example

Hereâ€™s an illustration:

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int x = 10;
    // A compiler extension might allow:
    int y;
    y = x + 20; // Use of 'y' without initialization might work on some compilers.

    std::cout << y << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

In standard C++, using an uninitialized variable like `y` is undefined behavior, but a permissive compiler might allow it. Disabling extensions would force you to fix such issues, making your code standard-compliant and portable.

==> Non Standard Code Example
	#include <iostream>
	
	int main() {
	    int x = 5;
	    int y = x + 10; // This is fine.
	
	    // Non-standard syntax: GCC allows inline assembly
	    asm ("mov %0, %1" : "=r"(x) : "r"(y));
	
	    std::cout << "x: " << x << std::endl;
	    return 0;
	}
The `asm` keyword for inline assembly is **not part of the C++ standard**. This program would work on GCC but might not compile on other compilers, making it non-standard.
