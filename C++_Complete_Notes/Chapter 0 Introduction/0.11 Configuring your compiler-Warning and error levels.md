- When compiler encounters an issue, it will emit `diagnostic message`. The C++ standard does not define how diagnostic message should be categorized, worded, or how it should effect the compilation of program. However, modern compiler have conventionally adopted the following:
	- A **diagnostic error** means the compiler has decided to halt compilation, because it either cannot proceed or deems the error serious enough to stop.
	- A **diagnostic warning** means the compiler has decided not to halt compilation. In such cases, the issue is simply ignored, and compilation proceeds.
- So there is an issue here, let me define the issue first, Compilers determine if it should give warning or an error but issue arise when conflict of compilers occur, it may give warning in one compiler lets say mine compiler which is g++ for linux but gives error in other compiler.
### Increasing your warning levels

[About Warning Levels](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/configuring-your-compiler-warning-and-error-levels/#:~:text=Increasing%20your%20warning,program%20to%20malfunction.)

### Treat warnings as errors
- It is also possible to tell your compiler to treat all warnings as if they were errors (in which case, the compiler will halt compilation if it finds any warnings). This is a good way to enforce the recommendation that you should fix all warnings (if you lack self-discipline, which most of us do).
