### C and C++’s philosophy

- ==> The underlying design philosophy of C and C++ can be summed up as “trust the programmer” -- which is both wonderful and dangerous. C++ is designed to allow the programmer a high degree of freedom to do what they want. However, this also means the language often won’t stop you from doing things that don’t make sense, because it will assume you’re doing so for some reason it doesn’t understand. There are quite a few pitfalls that new programmers are likely to fall into if caught unaware. This is one of the primary reasons why knowing what you shouldn’t do in C/C++ is almost as important as knowing what you should do.

### Q: What is C++ good at?

- C++ excels in situations where high performance and precise control over memory and other resources is needed. Here are a few types of applications that C++ would excel in:

	- Video games
	- Real-time systems (e.g. for transportation, manufacturing, etc…)
	- High-performance financial applications (e.g. high frequency trading)
	- Graphical applications and simulations
	- Productivity / office applications
	- Embedded software
	- Audio and video processing
	- Artificial intelligence and neural networks
	
	C++ also has a large number of high-quality 3rd party libraries available, which can shorten development times significantly.
