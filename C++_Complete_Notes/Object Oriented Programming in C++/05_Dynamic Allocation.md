# Dynamic memory allocation with new and delete

### The need for dynamic memory allocation

The need for dynamic memory allocation

C++ supports three basic types of memory allocation, of which you‚Äôve already seen two.

- **Static memory allocation**¬†happens for static and global variables. Memory for these types of variables is allocated once when your program is run and persists throughout the life of your program.
- **Automatic memory allocation**¬†happens for function parameters and local variables. Memory for these types of variables is allocated when the relevant block is entered, and freed when the block is exited, as many times as necessary.
- **Dynamic memory allocation**¬†is the topic of this article.

Both static and automatic allocation have two things in common:

- The size of the variable / array must be known at compile time.
- Memory allocation and deallocation happens automatically (when the variable is instantiated / destroyed).

>Most of the time, this is just fine. However, you will come across situations where one or both of these constraints cause problems, usually when dealing with external (user or file) input.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Why This Becomes a Problem

There are many real-world situations where we **don‚Äôt know** the size we need until the program runs.

Examples:

- You don‚Äôt know how long a user‚Äôs name is until they enter it.
    
- You don‚Äôt know how many records are in a file until you open it.
    
- You don‚Äôt know how many enemies (monsters) exist in a game at a given moment.
    

If you must decide the size at compile time, your only choice is to **guess** a maximum value:

```cpp
char name[25];      // hope no one has a longer name
Record record[500]; // hope no more than 500 records
Monster monster[40];
```

### üí£ 4. The Four Big Problems With This Approach

#### **(1) Wasted Memory**

You must allocate enough for the ‚Äúworst case,‚Äù so most of it stays unused.  
Example:

```cpp
char name[25];  // but most names are < 12 characters
```

‚Üí Half the space is wasted for every name.  
In large programs, this adds up to **huge memory waste**.

#### **(2) Managing Which Memory Is Actually Used**

You must track which slots are used or free manually.

Example:

```cpp
Monster monster[40];
```

- Is `monster[24]` active?
    
- Has it been initialized yet?  
    You might need an extra flag for each entry, making code messy and inefficient.

#### **(3) Limited Stack Size**

- **Automatic variables** (local variables, fixed arrays) are stored on the **stack**.
    
- Stack memory is **small** (around 1 MB on most systems).
    
- Large arrays can easily cause a **stack overflow**, crashing your program.
    

Example:

```cpp
int main() {
    int array[1000000]; // ~4MB -> too large for stack -> crash
}
```

‚Üí The stack isn‚Äôt meant for large or flexible data storage.

#### **(4) Artificial Limits and Overflow Risks**

If the user needs **more space than you reserved**, you hit a hard limit:

```cpp
Record record[500];  // what if there are 600 records?
```

Options:

- Stop and show an error (annoying for users)
    
- Read only part of the data (incomplete)
    
- Or worse: write beyond array bounds ‚Üí **undefined behavior** (crashes, corrupted data)

### üß† 5. The Solution ‚Äî Dynamic Memory Allocation

**Dynamic allocation** lets your program **request memory at runtime**, when it knows how much it needs.

- Memory comes from the **heap**, not the limited stack.
    
- Heap space is **much larger** (often several gigabytes).
    
- You can allocate exactly the amount needed ‚Äî no more guessing.

### Dynamically allocating single variables

To allocate a¬†_single_¬†variable dynamically, we use the scalar (non-array) form of the¬†**new**¬†operator:

```cpp
new int; // dynamically allocate an integer (and discard the result)
```

In the above case, we‚Äôre requesting an integer‚Äôs worth of memory from the operating system. The new operator creates the object using that memory, and then returns a pointer containing the¬†_address_¬†of the memory that has been allocated.

Most often, we‚Äôll assign the return value to our own pointer variable so we can access the allocated memory later.

```cpp
int* ptr{ new int }; // dynamically allocate an integer and assign the address to ptr so we can access it later
```

We can then dereference the pointer to access the memory:

```cpp
*ptr = 7; // assign value of 7 to allocated memory
```

If it wasn‚Äôt before, it should now be clear at least one case in which pointers are useful. Without a pointer to hold the address of the memory that was just allocated, we‚Äôd have no way to access the memory that was just allocated for us!

Note that accessing heap-allocated objects is generally slower than accessing stack-allocated objects. Because the compiler knows the address of stack-allocated objects, it can go directly to that address to get a value. Heap allocated objects are typically accessed via pointer. This requires two steps: one to get the address of the object (from the pointer), and another to get the value.

### How does dynamic memory allocation work?

#### üß† 1. What‚Äôs Happening in Your Computer‚Äôs Memory

When you run a program, your **operating system (OS)** loads it into memory (RAM).  
This memory is divided into **different regions**, each serving a special purpose:

|Memory Area|Purpose|
|---|---|
|**Code segment (text segment)**|Stores your program‚Äôs compiled instructions (the actual code).|
|**Data segment (global/static)**|Stores global and static variables.|
|**Stack**|Stores local variables and function call information (automatic storage).|
|**Heap**|Large area of free memory used for **dynamic allocation** (requested at runtime).|

So when your program runs, it only occupies part of your RAM ‚Äî the rest remains **available** to be handed out to programs that **ask for it**.

#### üß© 2. What Happens During Dynamic Allocation

When your program **dynamically allocates memory**, it‚Äôs doing something like this:

> ‚ÄúHey OS, I need some memory that I didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd need earlier.  
> Please give me a chunk of memory big enough to hold X.‚Äù

If the OS can fulfill that request, it:

1. Finds an unused region of the **heap** large enough.
    
2. Reserves (marks) that region as ‚Äúin use‚Äù.
    
3. Returns the **address** of the starting byte of that region to your program.
    

That address is stored in a **pointer** ‚Äî because a pointer holds memory addresses.

### Example in C++

```cpp
int* ptr = new int;  // asks OS for space to hold one integer
```

- The OS allocates space for an `int` (say 4 bytes).
    
- Returns the **memory address**, e.g. `0x6ffe20`.
    
- The pointer `ptr` now holds that address:

```cpp
ptr ‚Üí 0x6ffe20
*ptr = 0  // (uninitialized)
```

You can now use `*ptr` just like a normal variable:

```cpp
*ptr = 42;
std::cout << *ptr;  // prints 42
```

>When your program no longer needs that memory, it should give it back to the OS so that it can be reused. (delete)
>If you forget to `delete`, that memory stays ‚Äúin use‚Äù even though you can‚Äôt reach it anymore ‚Üí this is called a **memory leak**.

#### üìå 3. Why We Use Pointers for Heap Memory

The OS gives you the **memory address** of the allocated block.  
To store and access that memory, you need something that can hold an address ‚Äî that‚Äôs what **pointers** are for.

Example:

```cpp
int* number = new int(7);  // allocate and initialize to 7
std::cout << *number;      // prints 7

delete number;             // free it
number = nullptr;          // avoid dangling pointer
```

##### Key Idea:

You don‚Äôt access heap objects directly ‚Äî you access them **through their addresses**, which you keep in pointers.

#### ‚ö° 4. Visualizing It

Let‚Äôs imagine this simple code:

```cpp
int x = 5;          // stored on stack
int* p = new int(10);  // stored on heap
```

**Memory layout:**

```cpp
Stack:                         Heap:
+--------------------+          +----------------+
| x = 5             |          | 10             |
| p -> 0x600100     | -------> | (heap address) |
+--------------------+          +----------------+
```

- The variable `x` lives on the **stack**.
    
- The pointer `p` lives on the **stack**, but points to an integer on the **heap**.
    

#### üß† 4. Key Insight (from your passage)

> The allocation and deallocation for **stack objects** is automatic.  
> The allocation and deallocation for **heap objects** is **manual**.

This means:

- Stack: You don‚Äôt touch memory addresses or delete anything. The compiler does it.
    
- Heap: You must keep track of addresses and release them yourself.
    

So in dynamic memory allocation:

- You **request** memory ‚Üí using `new`
    
- You **use** it ‚Üí via pointer
    
- You **release** it ‚Üí using `delete`

### Initializing a dynamically allocated variable

When you dynamically allocate a variable, you can also initialize it via direct initialization or uniform initialization:

```cpp
int* ptr1{ new int (5) }; // use direct initialization
int* ptr2{ new int { 6 } }; // use uniform initialization
```

### Deleting a single variable

When we are done with a dynamically allocated variable, we need to explicitly tell C++ to free the memory for reuse. For single variables, this is done via the scalar (non-array) form of the¬†**delete**¬†operator:

```cpp
// assume ptr has previously been allocated with operator new
delete ptr; // return the memory pointed to by ptr to the operating system
ptr = nullptr; // set ptr to be a null pointer
```

### What does it mean to delete memory?

The delete operator does not¬†_actually_¬†delete anything. It simply returns the memory being pointed to back to the operating system. The operating system is then free to reassign that memory to another application (or to this application again later).

#### üí°  What Actually Happens

When you write `delete ptr;`, you are **not deleting the pointer** and **not deleting the variable itself**.

Here‚Äôs what really happens under the hood:

1. The pointer `ptr` holds an **address** of some memory block on the **heap** (allocated earlier using `new`).
    
2. The `delete` operator tells the **operating system (via the runtime system)**:
    
    > ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done using the memory block that starts at this address.  
    > Please mark it as free so it can be reused later.‚Äù
    
3. The OS marks that memory region as **available** for reuse.
    
4. The **pointer variable itself** is **not destroyed** ‚Äî it still exists and still holds the same old address, but that address is now invalid (the memory is no longer yours).
    

That‚Äôs why we say:

> `delete` **returns** the memory to the OS ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt actually destroy it.

>Note that deleting a pointer that is not pointing to dynamically allocated memory may cause bad things to happen.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è  Dangling Pointer Example

```cpp
int* ptr = new int(5);
delete ptr;     // memory returned to OS
*ptr = 10;      // ‚ùå undefined behavior (memory no longer yours!)
```

The pointer `ptr` still exists, but the memory it points to has been freed.  
Accessing or writing to that address can crash the program or corrupt data.

‚úÖ The safe practice:

```cpp
delete ptr;
ptr = nullptr;  // now it's clearly marked as "points to nothing"
```

### Dangling pointers

#### **What is a Dangling Pointer?**

A **dangling pointer** is a pointer that _points to memory which has already been freed (deallocated)_.

This is dangerous because the pointer still holds an _address_, but that memory is no longer valid or safe to use. Accessing it causes **undefined behavior** ‚Äî meaning _anything can happen_ (crash, garbage output, etc.).

#### **Why Does This Happen?**

When you use `new`, memory is given to your program.  
When you use `delete`, that memory is returned to the operating system.

**IMPORTANT:**  
`delete` only frees the memory ‚Äî **it does not erase or change the pointer itself**.  
The pointer still holds the old address ‚Üí now pointing to _invalid memory_ ‚Üí **dangling pointer**.

#### **Example 1: Simple Dangling Pointer**

```cpp
int* ptr{ new int };   // Memory allocated
*ptr = 7;              // Value assigned

delete ptr;            // Memory freed, ptr is now dangling!

std::cout << *ptr;     // ‚ùå Undefined behavior
delete ptr;            // ‚ùå Double delete -> Undefined behavior
```

### What Can Go Wrong?

- It may print `7` (old value still there)
    
- It may print garbage
    
- It may crash the program
    
- It may access memory now used by another program

#### **Example 2: Multiple Dangling Pointers**

```cpp
int* ptr{ new int{} };
int* otherPtr{ ptr };   // Both point to same memory

delete ptr;             // Memory freed

ptr = nullptr;          // ptr is safe now
// BUT otherPtr still points to freed memory -> dangling!
```

Even though `ptr` was set to `nullptr`, `otherPtr` is still dangerous!

#### **Why Dangling Pointers Are Dangerous**

- **Reading** ‚Üí May access invalid data or crash
    
- **Writing** ‚Üí May overwrite memory of another program
    
- **Deleting again** ‚Üí Double free ‚Üí Crash or security bugs
    

This is why they cause **undefined behavior**.

#### **Why Dangling Pointers Are Dangerous**

- **Reading** ‚Üí May access invalid data or crash
    
- **Writing** ‚Üí May overwrite memory of another program
    
- **Deleting again** ‚Üí Double free ‚Üí Crash or security bugs
    

This is why they cause **undefined behavior**.

#### **Best Practices to Avoid Dangling Pointers**

‚úÖ **1. Set pointers to `nullptr` after deleting**

‚úÖ **2. Avoid multiple raw pointers owning the same memory**  
Use only one pointer responsible for deleting.

‚úÖ **3. Use smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`)**  
They automatically manage memory safely. (We haven't learned it yet!)

#### **Key Takeaway**

> **A dangling pointer is like having an old house key after the house is demolished ‚Äì  
> if you try to use it, you‚Äôll get into trouble.**

### Operator new can fail

When requesting memory from the operating system, in rare circumstances, the operating system may not have any memory to grant the request with.

By default, if new fails, a¬†_bad_alloc_¬†exception is thrown. If this exception isn‚Äôt properly handled (and it won‚Äôt be, since we haven‚Äôt covered exceptions or exception handling yet), the program will simply terminate (crash) with an unhandled exception error.

In many cases, having new throw an exception (or having your program crash) is undesirable, so there‚Äôs an alternate form of new that can be used instead to tell new to return a null pointer if memory can‚Äôt be allocated. This is done by adding the constant std::nothrow between the new keyword and the allocation type:

```cpp
int* value { new (std::nothrow) int }; // value will be set to a null pointer if the integer allocation fails
```

In the above example, if new fails to allocate memory, it will return a null pointer instead of the address of the allocated memory.

Note that if you then attempt to dereference this pointer, undefined behavior will result (most likely, your program will crash). Consequently, the best practice is to check all memory requests to ensure they actually succeeded before using the allocated memory.

```cpp
int* value { new (std::nothrow) int{} }; // ask for an integer's worth of memory
if (!value) // handle case where new returned null
{
    // Do error handling here
    std::cerr << "Could not allocate memory\n";
}
```

Because asking new for memory only fails rarely (and almost never in a dev environment), it‚Äôs common to forget to do this check!

### Null pointers and dynamic memory allocation

Null pointers (pointers set to nullptr) are particularly useful when dealing with dynamic memory allocation. In the context of dynamic memory allocation, a null pointer basically says ‚Äúno memory has been allocated to this pointer‚Äù. This allows us to do things like conditionally allocate memory:

```cpp
// If ptr isn't already allocated, allocate it
if (!ptr)
    ptr = new int;
```

Deleting a null pointer has no effect. Thus, there is no need for the following:

```cpp
if (ptr) // if ptr is not a null pointer
    delete ptr; // delete it
// otherwise do nothing
```

Instead, you can just write:

```cpp
delete ptr;
```

If ptr is non-null, the dynamically allocated memory will be deleted. If ptr is null, nothing will happen.

>[!Best Practice]
>Deleting a null pointer is okay, and does nothing. There is no need to conditionalize your delete statements.

### Memory leaks

Dynamically allocated memory stays allocated until it is explicitly deallocated or until the program ends (and the operating system cleans it up, assuming your operating system does that). However, the pointers used to hold dynamically allocated memory addresses follow the normal scoping rules for local variables. This mismatch can create interesting problems.

Consider the following function:

```cpp
void doSomething()
{
    int* ptr{ new int{} };
}
```

This function allocates an integer dynamically, but never frees it using delete. Because pointers variables are just normal variables, when the function ends, ptr will go out of scope. And because ptr is the only variable holding the address of the dynamically allocated integer, when ptr is destroyed there are no more references to the dynamically allocated memory. This means the program has now ‚Äúlost‚Äù the address of the dynamically allocated memory. As a result, this dynamically allocated integer can not be deleted.

This is called a¬†**memory leak**. Memory leaks happen when your program loses the address of some bit of dynamically allocated memory before giving it back to the operating system. When this happens, your program can‚Äôt delete the dynamically allocated memory, because it no longer knows where it is. The operating system also can‚Äôt use this memory, because that memory is considered to be still in use by your program.

Memory leaks eat up free memory while the program is running, making less memory available not only to this program, but to other programs as well. Programs with severe memory leak problems can eat all the available memory, causing the entire machine to run slowly or even crash. Only after your program terminates is the operating system able to clean up and ‚Äúreclaim‚Äù all leaked memory.

Although memory leaks can result from a pointer going out of scope, there are other ways that memory leaks can result. For example, a memory leak can occur if a pointer holding the address of the dynamically allocated memory is assigned another value:

```cpp
int value = 5;
int* ptr{ new int{} }; // allocate memory
ptr = &value; // old address lost, memory leak results
```

This can be fixed by deleting the pointer before reassigning it:

```cpp
int value{ 5 };
int* ptr{ new int{} }; // allocate memory
delete ptr; // return memory back to operating system
ptr = &value; // reassign pointer to address of value
```

Relatedly, it is also possible to get a memory leak via double-allocation:

```cpp
int* ptr{ new int{} };
ptr = new int{}; // old address lost, memory leak results
```

The address returned from the second allocation overwrites the address of the first allocation. Consequently, the first allocation becomes a memory leak!

Similarly, this can be avoided by ensuring you delete the pointer before reassigning.

### Conclusion

Operators new and delete allow us to dynamically allocate single variables for our programs.

Dynamically allocated memory has dynamic duration and will stay allocated until you deallocate it or the program terminates.

Be careful not to perform dereference a dangling or null pointers.

# Dynamically allocating arrays

### üîç What Are Dynamically Allocated Arrays?

In normal (fixed) arrays like:

```cpp
int arr[5];
```

The size (`5`) must be **known at compile time** ‚Äî it must be a constant.

But what if we only know the size **at runtime** (when the program is running)?  
That‚Äôs where **dynamic arrays** come in ‚Äî created using `new[]`.

### üß† Why Use Dynamic Arrays?

- ‚úÖ Size decided by **user input or runtime logic**
    
- ‚úÖ Can create **very large arrays**
    
- ‚ùå Must be manually **deleted** to free memory

#### üß± Syntax: Dynamic Array with `new[]`

```cpp
int* array = new int[length];
```

- `new int[length]` ‚Üí Allocates an array of `int` with the given size.
    
- `array` is a pointer to the first element.
    

#### üóëÔ∏è Freeing Memory: Use `delete[]`

```cpp
delete[] array;
```

> **Important:** Use `delete[]` for arrays  
> Use `delete` for single variables

#### üß™ Example Explained

```cpp
#include <cstddef>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter a positive integer: ";
    std::size_t length{};
    std::cin >> length;

    int* array{ new int[length]{} }; // Dynamically allocate array

    std::cout << "I just allocated an array of integers of length " << length << '\n';

    array[0] = 5;  // Example usage

    delete[] array; // Free memory

    return 0;
}
```

#### üí° Benefits of Dynamic Allocation

|Feature|Fixed Array (`int arr[5];`)|Dynamic Array (`new int[n];`)|
|---|---|---|
|Size known at|Compile-time|Runtime|
|Memory location|Stack|Heap|
|Max size|Limited|Very large possible|
|Can resize later?|No|No (but can reallocate)|
#### üß≠ Author‚Äôs Note Mentioned:

> _Why not use `std::array` or `std::vector`?_

- `std::array` is fixed-size ‚Üí compile-time only
    
- `std::vector` is **better** than raw dynamic arrays ‚Üí auto memory management
    
- We use `new[]` here **only for learning purposes**

#### ‚úÖ Final Key Points

- Use `new[]` to create runtime-sized arrays
    
- Always pair it with `delete[]`
    
- Use `std::size_t` for array sizes
    
- Modern C++ prefers `std::vector` for safety

### Dynamically deleting arrays

When deleting a dynamically allocated array, we have to use the array version of delete, which is delete[].

>One often asked question of array delete[] is, ‚ÄúHow does array delete know how much memory to delete?‚Äù The answer is that array new[] keeps track of how much memory was allocated to a variable, so that array delete[] can delete the proper amount. Unfortunately, this size/length isn‚Äôt accessible to the programmer.

### Dynamic arrays are almost identical to fixed arrays

you learned that a fixed array holds the memory address of the first array element. You also learned that a fixed array can decay into a pointer that points to the first element of the array. In this decayed form, the length of the fixed array is not available (and therefore neither is the size of the array via sizeof()), but otherwise there is little difference.

A dynamic array starts its life as a pointer that points to the first element of the array. Consequently, it has the same limitations in that it doesn‚Äôt know its length or size. A dynamic array functions identically to a decayed fixed array, with the exception that the programmer is responsible for deallocating the dynamic array via the delete[] keyword.

### Initializing dynamically allocated arrays

If you want to initialize a dynamically allocated array to 0, the syntax is quite simple:

```cpp
int* array{ new int[length]{} };
```

starting with C++11, it‚Äôs now possible to initialize dynamic arrays using initializer lists!

```cpp
int fixedArray[5] = { 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 }; // initialize a fixed array before C++11
int* array{ new int[5]{ 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 } }; // initialize a dynamic array since C++11
// To prevent writing the type twice, we can use auto. This is often done for types with long names.
auto* array{ new int[5]{ 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 } };
```

Note that this syntax has no operator= between the array length and the initializer list.

For consistency, fixed arrays can also be initialized using uniform initialization:

```cpp
int fixedArray[]{ 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 }; // initialize a fixed array in C++11
char fixedArray[]{ "Hello, world!" }; // initialize a fixed array in C++11
```

Explicitly stating the size of the array is optional.

### Resizing arrays

Dynamically allocating an array allows you to set the array length at the time of allocation. However, C++ does not provide a built-in way to resize an array that has already been allocated. It is possible to work around this limitation by dynamically allocating a new array, copying the elements over, and deleting the old array. However, this is error prone, especially when the element type is a class (which have special rules governing how they are created).

Consequently, we recommend avoiding doing this yourself. Use¬†`std::vector`¬†instead.

# Destructors

###  üßπ What Is a **Destructor** in C++?

A **destructor** is a special member function in a class that is automatically called when an object is **destroyed**.

- A **constructor** is used to **set up** the object (initialization).
    
- A **destructor** is used to **clean up** the object (release resources).

#### üïí When Is a Destructor Called?

A destructor is called automatically when:

‚úÖ An object **goes out of scope**  
‚úÖ A dynamically allocated object is **deleted using `delete`**

You don‚Äôt call a destructor yourself ‚Äî C++ handles it for you.

#### üõë Why Do We Need a Destructor?

For **simple classes** (only normal variables like `int`, `std::string`), C++ automatically cleans memory ‚Äî no need for a destructor.

But if a class uses **external resources**, such as:

- üß† Dynamic memory (`new`)
    
- üìÅ File handles
    
- üîå Database or network connections
    

Then we _must_ clean these resources manually before the object is destroyed. That‚Äôs what a destructor is for.

#### üí° Key Takeaway

> Use a **destructor** when your class manages resources that won‚Äôt be cleaned up automatically ‚Äî like memory allocated with `new`.

>Generally you should not call a destructor explicitly (as it will be called automatically when the object is destroyed), since there are rarely cases where you‚Äôd want to clean up an object more than once. However, destructors may safely call other member functions since the object isn‚Äôt destroyed until after the destructor executes.

### A destructor example

Let‚Äôs take a look at a simple class that uses a destructor:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cassert>
#include <cstddef>

class IntArray
{
private:
	int* m_array{};
	int m_length{};

public:
	IntArray(int length) // constructor
	{
		assert(length > 0);

		m_array = new int[static_cast<std::size_t>(length)]{};
		m_length = length;
	}

	~IntArray() // destructor
	{
		// Dynamically delete the array we allocated earlier
		delete[] m_array;
	}

	void setValue(int index, int value) { m_array[index] = value; }
	int getValue(int index) { return m_array[index]; }

	int getLength() { return m_length; }
};

int main()
{
	IntArray ar ( 10 ); // allocate 10 integers
	for (int count{ 0 }; count < ar.getLength(); ++count)
		ar.setValue(count, count+1);

	std::cout << "The value of element 5 is: " << ar.getValue(5) << '\n';

	return 0;
} // ar is destroyed here, so the ~IntArray() destructor function is called here
```

>On the first line of main(), we instantiate a new IntArray class object called ar, and pass in a length of 10. This calls the constructor, which dynamically allocates memory for the array member. We must use dynamic allocation here because we do not know at compile time what the length of the array is (the caller decides that).

At the end of main(), ar goes out of scope. This causes the ~IntArray() destructor to be called, which deletes the array that we allocated in the constructor!

### Constructor and destructor timing

Constructor and destructor timing

As mentioned previously, the constructor is called when an object is created, and the destructor is called when an object is destroyed. In the following example, we use cout statements inside the constructor and destructor to show this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Simple
{
private:
    int m_nID{};

public:
    Simple(int nID)
        : m_nID{ nID }
    {
        std::cout << "Constructing Simple " << nID << '\n';
    }

    ~Simple()
    {
        std::cout << "Destructing Simple" << m_nID << '\n';
    }

    int getID() { return m_nID; }
};

int main()
{
    // Allocate a Simple on the stack
    Simple simple{ 1 };
    std::cout << simple.getID() << '\n';

    // Allocate a Simple dynamically
    Simple* pSimple{ new Simple{ 2 } };

    std::cout << pSimple->getID() << '\n';

    // We allocated pSimple dynamically, so we have to delete it.
    delete pSimple;

    return 0;
} // simple goes out of scope here
```

This program produces the following result:

Constructing Simple 1
1
Constructing Simple 2
2
Destructing Simple 2
Destructing Simple 1

Note that ‚ÄúSimple 1‚Äù is destroyed after ‚ÄúSimple 2‚Äù because we deleted pSimple before the end of the function, whereas simple was not destroyed until the end of main().

Global variables are constructed before main() and destroyed after main().

### üèõÔ∏è What is **RAII** in C++?

**RAII** stands for **Resource Acquisition Is Initialization**.

It‚Äôs a technique in C++ where **resource management** (like memory, files, sockets, etc.) is tied to the **lifetime of an object**.

#### üéØ Why RAII is Important?

RAII helps prevent:

‚ùå **Memory leaks** (forgetting `delete`)  
‚ùå **File handles left open**  
‚ùå **Resource misuse**

‚úÖ RAII ensures resources are _always cleaned up_, even if exceptions occur.

#### üß≠ How RAII Works Internally

| Operation                                          | Happens in            |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Acquire resource (`new`, open file, connect to DB) | **Constructor**       |
| Use the resource                                   | While object is alive |
| Release resource (`delete`, close file)            | **Destructor**        |
#### üîé Example of RAII Concept

```cpp
class FileHandler {
private:
    FILE* file;
public:
    FileHandler(const char* filename) {
        file = fopen(filename, "r");  // acquire resource
    }

    ~FileHandler() {
        fclose(file);  // automatically release resource
    }
};
```

When `FileHandler` object goes out of scope ‚Üí file is automatically closed.  
No risk of forgetting!

#### üß∞ Real RAII Examples in C++

| Class             | Resource Managed              |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `std::string`     | Dynamic memory for characters |
| `std::vector`     | Dynamic memory for elements   |
| `std::fstream`    | File handles                  |
| `std::unique_ptr` | Dynamically allocated memory  |

All of these classes **automatically** clean their resources in destructors ‚Üí following RAII.

#### üîê RAII = Safety

> **RAII ties resource lifetime to object lifetime**  
> ‚Üí No need for manual cleanup  
> ‚Üí No memory leaks  
> ‚Üí Exception-safe code

#### üèÅ Final Summary

|Concept|Meaning|
|---|---|
|RAII|Resource Acquisition Is Initialization|
|Constructor|Gets the resource|
|Destructor|Releases it automatically|
|Benefit|No leaks, safer code|

### A warning about the std::exit() function

Note that if you use the std::exit() function, your program will terminate and no destructors will be called. Be wary if you‚Äôre relying on your destructors to do necessary cleanup work (e.g. write something to a log file or database before exiting).

### Summary

==As you can see, when constructors and destructors are used together, your classes can initialize and clean up after themselves without the programmer having to do any special work! This reduces the probability of making an error, and makes classes easier to use.

# Pointers to pointers and dynamic multidimensional arrays

>This lesson is optional, for advanced readers who want to learn more about C++. No future lessons build on this lesson.

A pointer to a pointer is exactly what you‚Äôd expect: a pointer that holds the address of another pointer.

### üîó What Is a **Pointer to a Pointer**?

A **pointer to a pointer** is a variable that stores the **address of another pointer** ‚Äî not directly the address of an int or other value.

It adds an _extra level of indirection_.

#### üß± Levels of Indirection

|Type|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`int`|Normal integer value|
|`int*`|Pointer to an integer (stores address of `int`)|
|`int**`|Pointer to a pointer to an integer (stores address of `int*`)|
#### üñã Declaration

```cpp
int* ptr;      // Pointer to int
int** ptrptr;  // Pointer to a pointer to int
```

#### üß™ Example with Dereferencing

```cpp
int value { 5 };

int* ptr { &value };        // ptr points to value
std::cout << *ptr << '\n';  // Dereference once -> value of 'value'

int** ptrptr { &ptr };      // ptrptr points to ptr
std::cout << **ptrptr << '\n'; // Double dereference -> value of 'value'
```

```Output
5
5
```

#### üö´ Invalid Attempt

```cpp
int value { 5 };
int** ptrptr { &&value }; // ‚ùå Not valid!
```

Why?

- `&value` is an **rvalue** (temporary)
    
- `&` operator needs an **lvalue**
    
- You cannot take the address of a temporary

#### ‚úÖ Valid Null Initialization

```cpp
int** ptrptr { nullptr }; // Allowed
```

### **Arrays of pointers**

#### üßµ What Is an **Array of Pointers**?

It is an array where **each element is a pointer** (not a normal value like `int` or `char`).

Example:

```cpp
int** array = new int*[10];
```

#### What does this mean?

- `array` is a pointer to **the first element of an array**
    
- The array has **10 elements**
    
- Each element is an `int*` (pointer to integer)  
    ‚Üí So it's **an array of 10 integer pointers**

#### üß± Visualization

Imagine we created:

```cpp
int** array = new int*[3];
```

|Index|array[i] (each element)|
|---|---|
|array[0]|Pointer to int (`int*`)|
|array[1]|Pointer to int (`int*`)|
|array[2]|Pointer to int (`int*`)|

But right now, these pointers are **uninitialized** ‚Äî they don‚Äôt point anywhere yet!

#### üß™ Example: Using Array of Pointers

```cpp
int** array = new int*[3];  // Array of 3 int pointers

array[0] = new int(10);     // Each pointer points to separate int
array[1] = new int(20);
array[2] = new int(30);

std::cout << *array[0] << '\n'; // 10
std::cout << *array[1] << '\n'; // 20
std::cout << *array[2] << '\n'; // 30
```

### **Two-dimensional dynamically allocated arrays**

Another common use for pointers to pointers is to facilitate dynamically allocated multidimensional arrays.

#### ‚ùå Why `int** array { new int[10][5] };` Won‚Äôt Work

You might think:

```cpp
int** array = new int[10][5]; // WRONG!
```

But this fails because:

- `int**` means ‚Äúpointer to pointer to int‚Äù.
    
- `new int[10][5]` creates a **block of 50 integers** in continuous memory ‚Äî NOT a pointer-to-pointer structure.
    
- They are incompatible types.

#### ‚úÖ Solution 1: If Rightmost Dimension is Constant

> We will skip this because its not practical because columns needs to be constant.
> 

#### üß± Solution 2: True Dynamic 2D Array Using `int**`

##### Step 1Ô∏è‚É£: Allocate an array of row pointers

```cpp
int** array { new int*[10] }; // 10 rows
```

Now memory layout:

```cpp
array ‚Üí [ * ][ * ][ * ][ * ] ... (10 pointers)
         |   |   |
         ?   ?   ?
```

Each pointer will point to a row.

##### Step 2Ô∏è‚É£: Allocate each row separately

```cpp
for (int i {0}; i < 10; ++i)
    array[i] = new int[5];   // 5 columns
```

Now memory layout:

```cpp
array ‚Üí row0 ‚Üí [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
         row1 ‚Üí [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
         row2 ‚Üí [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
         ...
```

‚úÖ Now you can access like:

```cpp
array[9][4] = 3;
```

>Since each row is allocated separately, each row can have **different column sizes**!

#### üóë Deallocating Memory Properly (Very Important!)

Delete EVERY row first:

```cpp
for (int i {0}; i < 10; ++i)
    delete[] array[i];   // delete each row
```

Then delete main row pointer array:

```cpp
delete[] array;
```

‚ö†Ô∏è If you do `delete[] array` first ‚Üí you lose access to rows ‚Üí memory leak / UB.

#### üßÆ Tip: Flatten 2D to 1D (Simpler & Faster)

Instead of complex `int**`, just use a **single 1D array** with size `rows * cols`.

```cpp
int* array { new int[50] }; // A 10x5 array
```

To convert (row, col) ‚Üí single index:

```cpp
int getSingleIndex(int row, int col, int numCols)
{
    return (row * numCols) + col;
}

array[getSingleIndex(9, 4, 5)] = 3;
```

This is common in **competitive programming and graphics (like OpenGL)**.

### **Passing a pointer by address**

#### üéØ Goal: Change What a Pointer Points To (Inside a Function)

Normally, when you pass a pointer to a function, you can modify the value it _points to_, but **you cannot change where that pointer itself points** (its address) unless you pass it by address or reference.

#### üßµ Part 1: Passing a Pointer by Address (Using `int**` address of that pointer) 

You use **pointer to pointer** (`int**`) so the function can modify the original pointer.

##### üõ† Example: Using `int**`

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void changePointer(int** ptr) {   // ptr is a pointer to pointer
    *ptr = new int;  // single astrik because we are dereferencing the pointer so we will get pointer and we can change where that pointer is pointing            // change where original pointer points
    **ptr = 20;                   // assign value
}

int main() {
    int* p = nullptr;
    changePointer(&p);            // pass address of pointer
    cout << *p;                   // output: 20
    delete p;
}
```

##### üß† Explanation

- `p` is a pointer in `main`.
    
- We pass `&p` (address of pointer) ‚Üí so inside function we get `int**`.
    
- Inside `changePointer`, we modify `*ptr` (the real pointer `p`) to point to a new memory address.

##### üí° Problem with `int**`

Using `int**` is:

- Hard to read.
    
- Easy to make mistakes.
    
- More confusing for beginners.

#### ‚úÖ Better Way: Reference to Pointer (`int*&`)

This is cleaner and safer. Instead of `int**`, we use **reference to a pointer**.

##### ‚ú® Example using Reference to Pointer (`int*&`)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void changePointer(int*& ptr) {  // ptr is a reference to pointer
    ptr = new int;               // directly modify original pointer
    *ptr = 30;
}

int main() {
    int* p = nullptr;
    changePointer(p);            // pass pointer directly (easier!)
    cout << *p;                  // output: 30
    delete p;
}
```

#### üÜö Comparison: `int**` vs `int*&`

|Method|Syntax|Readability|Recommended|
|---|---|---|---|
|`int**`|Hard (`&p` required)|Confusing|‚ùå Less clear|
|`int*&`|Simple (`p` only)|Much clearer|‚úÖ Yes!|

#### üîç Why Reference to Pointer is Better?

‚úî You pass the pointer like normal (`changePointer(p)`)  
‚úî No need to use `&p`  
‚úî The function can _change where your pointer points_  
‚úî Syntax is cleaner and more C++-style

#### üéì Final Understanding

> If you want a function to **change the pointer itself** (not just the data it points to),  
> you must pass the pointer **by address (`int**`)** or **by reference (`int*&`)**.
> 
> üîî **In modern C++, use reference to pointer ‚Äî it‚Äôs cleaner.**

### **Conclusion**

We recommend avoiding using pointers to pointers unless no other options are available, because they‚Äôre complicated to use and potentially dangerous. It‚Äôs easy enough to dereference a null or dangling pointer with normal pointers ‚Äî it‚Äôs doubly easy with a pointer to a pointer since you have to do a double-dereference to get to the underlying value!

# Void Pointer

### üß© What is a **void pointer**?

A **void pointer (`void*`)** is a **generic pointer**.  
It can point to **any data type**, but it doesn't know the type it points to.

```cpp
void* ptr {}; // ptr is a void pointer
```

### üéØ Why is it special?

|Feature|What it can do|
|---|---|
|‚úÖ Can store the address of **any data type**||
|‚ùå Cannot be dereferenced directly (you must cast it first)||
|‚ùå Cannot do pointer arithmetic (like ptr + 1)||
|‚ùå Cannot be deleted safely without casting back||
### üß™ Example: Void pointer holding different types

```cpp
int nValue {};
float fValue {};
struct Something { int n; float f; } sValue {};

void* ptr {};
ptr = &nValue;  // OK
ptr = &fValue;  // OK
ptr = &sValue;  // OK
```

This flexibility is why it's called a **generic pointer**.

### üö´ But there‚Äôs a BIG problem‚Ä¶

Because `void*` doesn‚Äôt know **what type it points to**, you **cannot directly dereference** it.

```cpp
int value{ 5 };
void* voidPtr{ &value };

// std::cout << *voidPtr;  // ‚ùå ERROR! Type unknown!
```

### üõ† Solution: CAST before using

To use the value, convert (`static_cast`) the void pointer back to the correct type:

```cpp
int* intPtr = static_cast<int*>(voidPtr);
std::cout << *intPtr << '\n';   // ‚úÖ Output: 5
```

### ‚ùì But how do we know what type to cast back to?

**YOU must remember it!**  
The compiler doesn‚Äôt know ‚Äî this is why void pointers are dangerous.

### üñ®Ô∏è Practical Use Example: Printing different types

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cassert>

enum class Type { tInt, tFloat, tCString };

void printValue(void* ptr, Type type)
{
    switch (type)
    {
    case Type::tInt:
        std::cout << *static_cast<int*>(ptr) << '\n';
        break;
    case Type::tFloat:
        std::cout << *static_cast<float*>(ptr) << '\n';
        break;
    case Type::tCString:
        std::cout << static_cast<char*>(ptr) << '\n'; // char* directly prints string
        break;
    default:
        std::cerr << "Invalid type\n";
        assert(false);
    }
}

int main()
{
    int nValue{ 5 };
    float fValue{ 7.5f };
    char szValue[]{ "Mollie" };

    printValue(&nValue, Type::tInt);
    printValue(&fValue, Type::tFloat);
    printValue(szValue, Type::tCString);
}
```

5
7.5
Mollie

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Rules About `void*`

|Rule|Explanation|
|---|---|
|‚úÖ Can be `nullptr`|`void* ptr = nullptr;`|
|‚ùå Cannot be dereferenced|Must cast to correct type first|
|‚ùå Cannot do pointer arithmetic|Because no type/size info|
|‚ùå Cannot delete safely|Must cast back before deleting|
|‚ùå No void references|`void&` doesn't exist|
### üß® Danger Example (Compiler Won‚Äôt Stop You)

```cpp
int nValue{ 5 };
printValue(&nValue, Type::tCString); // Wrong type passed!
```

This compiles, but output is **garbage**.  
No type checking ‚Äî dangerous!

### üõ° Final Advice

|Is `void*` safe?|Better Alternatives|
|---|---|
|‚ùå No type safety|‚úÖ Function overloading|
|‚ùå Easy to misuse|‚úÖ Templates|
|‚ùå Hard to debug|‚úÖ `std::variant`, `std::any`|
### üèÅ Conclusion

> **Use void pointers only when necessary (low-level code, C libraries).**  
> In modern C++, there are **much safer methods** that retain type checking.

==What‚Äôs the difference between a void pointer and a null pointer?

>A void pointer is a pointer that can point to any type of object, but does not know what type of object it points to. A void pointer must be explicitly cast into another type of pointer to perform indirection. A null pointer is a pointer that does not point to an address. A void pointer can be a null pointer.

Thus, a void pointer refers to the type of the pointer, whereas a null pointer refers to the value (address) of the pointer.
